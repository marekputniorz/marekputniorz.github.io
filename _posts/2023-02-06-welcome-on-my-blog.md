Hello! My name is Marek and this is my new personal blog where I will publish things about technologies and about life of the normal IT guy.
I am working now as a DevOps Engineer at Tietoevry which is Nordic company. I live in the city with name Karvina which is located in the Czech Republic near the border with Poland. In my freetime I like reading books on my Kindle, playing video games and workout.
