## Introduction

I decided that from today I am starting Monk mode. What is it? Monk mode is committing to a goal without distractions. Basically it is way to work and live without any social networks like Facebook, Instagram, Youtube, Twitter etc. For me it is easier because I have only Twitter and Youtube. Also video games and adult sites are prohibited.

## My plan

I planned this experiment for 3 months which is the minimal time for my brain to recover from disctractions which I have already described in previous article. Basicaly I created the program for maximal productivity which consists of exercising, meditation, reading bible or any spiritual or religious book and reading optional book. These activities will have duration of 1 hour only. This is optimal time. I wrote in the beginning that video games are prohibited but I want to have something like "cheat time" for that. So I created 1 hour time slot for playing video games.

But what about the most important thing? Yeah. Work. This is the most interesting part of this experiment. Work is the most important part of this experiment. I will use pomodoro technic for "deep work".

## Pomodoro technic

*The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a kitchen timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.*

I copy-pasted this description from Wikipedia. It is really good technic for maximal productivity. 

I will have 8 sessions with duration of 25 minutes and 8 breaks with duration of 5 minutes. Also I am using this technic right now.

In free time I also want to learn something new. So for this I will have 2 hours on work days and on weekend days it will be optional. Normally I want to recover from work days on the weekend but if I will want to learn something it will take 4 hours. And I will also use pomodoro.

## Conclusion

So that's it. I am really excited how this journey will continue. I also created video for myself which I will play everyday to remind me why I started. I will also write some articles when I reach 10 or 15 days so be ready for update!
